# KREBBOT

Hello! Welcome to KREBBOT!

KREBBOT was a fun little coding experiment, turned passion project, turned actual useful bot. Plus, this has been a great learning experience for me with Python.

KREBBOT is still very much in progress. I am slowly implementing things, often in bursts of random coding!

I have a lot of ideas, but this is easily the biggest software product I have ever coded so I am taking things slow to ensure proper devops, etc.
