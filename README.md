# KREBBOT

Hello! Welcome to KREBBOT!

KREBBOT was a fun little coding experiment, turned passion project, turned actual useful bot. Plus, this has been a great learning experience for me with Python.

KREBBOT is still very much in progress. I am slowly implementing things, often in bursts of random coding, but eventually it would be pretty cool to release this as a minor moderation/fun bot!

I have a lot of ideas, but this is easily the biggest software product I have ever coded so I am taking things slow to ensure proper devops, etc.

For any questions, you can always reach out to me via twitch: TTV/notte_a_problem or via the discord server linked there.
