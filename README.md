# KREBBOT

Hello! Welcome to KREBBOT!

KREBBOT was a fun little coding experiment, turned passion project, turned actual useful bot. Plus, this has been a great learning experience for me with Python.

KREBBOT is still very much in progress. I am slowly implementing things, often in bursts of random coding!

I have a lot of ideas, but this is easily the biggest software product I have ever coded so I am taking things slow to ensure proper devops, etc.

Features of note:

Self-signed SSL Certificates serving HTTPS traffic to a webserver based on aiohttp, nginx, and certbot.
Automatic Moderation for multiple media formats
Fun features for users like Tarot cards, Astronomy/Astrology, etc.
Moderation and Utility commands for power users
A modular, OO-structured format of modules using the Cogs framework
Dev Ops & SCM Management including deployment to a dedicated VPS
Message parsing, handling, and storing in user-friendly formats
Dedicated reminder system/early Personal Assistant features
Automatic Role Assignment (or other actions) based on any user action, including reacts
Full-featured, schema-driven asyncronous PostgreSQL database designed and deployed from scratch
